# Does sex bias exist at the university in the most current year available (1995)?

```{r echo = T, results = 'hide'}

```


First, I will read in the whole dataset.
```{r}
salary_data <- read.table(file = "salary.txt", header = TRUE)
salary_data
```

Next, filter data to the year 1995.
```{r}
salary_data_1995 <- salary_data[salary_data$year == 95, ]
salary_data_1995
```

First, create visualizations for 1995 data: the distribution of academic field, year in which they attained their highest degree, year they were hired at the university, academic rank, and monthly salary in 1995 by sex.

```{r}
p_field_bar <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(x = field, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Fields of Work by Sex in 1995 (Absolute Count)",
       x = "Field",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
print(p_field_bar)
```

```{r}
yrdeg_means <- salary_data_1995 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_yrdeg = mean(yrdeg, na.rm = TRUE))

p7 <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(yrdeg))
plot_of_sex_vs_yrdeg <- p7 + geom_density(aes(fill = factor(sex)), alpha = 0.8) + 
    geom_vline(
    data = yrdeg_means,
    aes(xintercept = mean_yrdeg),
    linetype = "dashed",
    linewidth = 1
  ) +
  labs(title = "Sex vs Year when Highest Degree was attained in 1995 (Density Plot)", 
       x = "Year in which Highest Degree was Attained",
       fill = "sex")
plot_of_sex_vs_yrdeg
```

```{r}
hire_data <- salary_data_1995 %>%
  group_by(startyr, sex) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

avg_years <- hire_data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_year = sum(startyr * count) / sum(count),  # Weighted mean
    .groups = 'drop'
  )
avg_years
```

```{r}
p_hire_timeseries <- ggplot(hire_data, aes(x = startyr, y = count, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  # 3. Add vertical lines for each sex's average hire year
  geom_vline(
    data = avg_years,
    aes(xintercept = avg_year, color = sex),
    linetype = "dashed",
    size = 1
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Hires By Start Year for Employees in 1995",
    x = "Year of Hire",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
p_hire_timeseries
```

```{r}
p_hire_dens <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(x = startyr, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Hires by Start Year For Employees in 1995",
       x = "Year of Hire",
       y = "Proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  theme_minimal()
print(p_hire_dens)
```

```{r}
p_rank_95_count <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(x = rank, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Academic Rank in 1995 - Total Counts",
       x = "Rank",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
print(p_rank_95_count)
```

```{r}
p_rank_95_percent <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(x = rank, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  labs(title = "Academic Rank in 1995 - Percentage by Sex",
       x = "Rank",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()
print(p_rank_95_percent)
```

```{r}
p_salary_95_box <- ggplot(salary_data_1995, aes(x = sex, y = salary, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Salary Distribution by Sex in 1995",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Salary") +
  theme_minimal()
print(p_salary_95_box)
```
